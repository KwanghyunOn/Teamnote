G has a feasible (s,t)-flow iff G' has a saturating (s',t')-flow
in G' total capacity out of s' and into t' are both D (sum of demands)
saturating flow : flow with value exactly D.

1. Make new source, new sink (s', t')

2. for every v: 
c'(s'->v) = sum{ d(u->v) } (give demands into v)
c'(v->t') = sum{ d(v->w) } (take demands out of v)

3. for every u->v:
c'(u->v) = c(u->v) - d(u->v)  (difference of cap, demand)

3. make t->s cap:INF
